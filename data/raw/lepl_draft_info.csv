On Quinn I usually go ADC and have a aggressive lvl 1-6, then start roaming around the map after I hard push the wave. Other ADCs I can also perform with but it depends on what my support chooses to either be aggressive or passive in lane. For Top, I almost always choose a scaling champ like Gwen, Chogath, Aurora, Garen, Quinn and wait for my powerspikes to fight the enemy, also always rotate to grubs when my jungler wants to do them. What I look for in my teammates is definitely communication and accountability, especially from my support and jgl. I want to know what they are thinking of doing before they do it so I can quickly give input instead of them rushing in when I am not ready or do not see a good fight resulting from their action. I also look for a support that knows their champs' limits and know when to choose what (picking an enchanter when there is an enemy caitlyn or an engage when there is an enemy yuumi).
